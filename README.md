I) How Game Works

  1) Set the score between 100 - 99999
  2) Roll dice button will return arbirary number between 1-6
      i) if 1 comes on any one of the dice then trun switches to another player
      ii)  if 6 comes to any of the dice the turn switches to another player and the score also reset to 0.
  3) Player wins if the player's score is greater or equal to the set score.
